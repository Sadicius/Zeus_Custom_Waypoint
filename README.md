# Zeus Custom Waypoint
**Zeus Custom Waypoint** is a script that allows customizing map waypoints.

**Features;**

**Change Waypoint Color:** The color of the line for the waypoint on the map can be changed.

**Add Waypoint Blip:** You can select a blip for the end point of the waypoint. This provides a more personalized look on the map.

**Change Waypoint Blip Color/Style:** You can change the blip color and style (e.g. pulse effect).

## Installation
- Throw it into your `resources` folder
- Add `ensure Zeus_Custom_Waypoint` to your `server.cfg`

## NOTE
- Dependency `Standalone`
- Almost everything can be configured in `config.lua`
